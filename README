LINAI is an artificial intelligence of the Gomoku game (also known as Gobang)
It has been developped by 3 students, Gasparina Damien, Conrath Adrien,
Sednoaui Maxime in one weeks

We use alpha beta pruning (an improvement of the minmax algorithm).
To compile our project you need the boost library
(we use boost::asio for a network interface)

If you want more information you can contact me at 'gaspar_d@epita.fr'

To test our `AI` : ./bin/gobang play
